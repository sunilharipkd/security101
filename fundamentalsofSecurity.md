# Five Pillars of Information Security

The five pillars of information security work together to protect data from unauthorized access, ensure its accuracy, keep systems running, verify identities, and provide accountability. 
They are essential for maintaining trust, reducing risk, and ensuring that critical information remains secure and reliable in any IT environment

### Confidentiality
Ensures that information is kept secret and only accessible to those who are authorized.  
- **In essence:** “Only the right people should know.”  
- **Example:** Encrypting customer credit card details in an online store database.

---

### Integrity
Ensures that information remains accurate and unaltered by unauthorized changes.  
- **In essence:** “The data should stay correct and unchanged.”  
- **Example:** Using checksums to verify that a downloaded software file has not been tampered with.

---

### Availability
Ensures that information and systems are available when authorized users need them.  
- **In essence:** “The information must be there when needed.”  
- **Example:** A hospital maintaining backup power generators to keep critical medical systems running during a power outage.

---


### Authentication
Confirms the identity of a user, system, or device before granting access.  
- **In essence:** “Prove you are who you say you are.”  
- **Example:** Logging in to an email account using a username, password, and OTP.

---

### Non-Repudiation
Provides proof that an action or transaction actually took place and cannot be denied later.  
- **In essence:** “You can’t say you didn’t do it.”  
- **Example:** A digital signature on an official contract that proves who signed it and when.
