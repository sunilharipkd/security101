# AAA of Security

The AAA framework — Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting — forms the backbone of modern information security systems. It ensures that only legitimate users gain access, receive the proper permissions, and have their actions tracked for accountability.

## 1. Authentication

**Essence:**
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, system, or device. It answers the question: *“Are you who you claim to be?”*

**Example:**
When you log into your email account using a username and password, the system checks that your credentials match those stored in its database. Multi-factor authentication (MFA), such as entering a code sent to your phone, adds an extra layer of verification.



## 2. Authorization

**Essence:**
Authorization determines what resources or services an authenticated user is allowed to access. It answers: *“What are you allowed to do?”*

**Example:**
In a corporate network, after logging in (authentication), an employee may only have access to their department’s shared folders. They cannot view or edit files belonging to another department unless explicitly granted permission.




## 3. Accounting (or Auditing)

**Essence:**
Accounting involves tracking user activities and resource usage. It provides logs and reports that help organizations understand *“What did you do, and when?”*

**Example:**
In a cloud service environment, detailed logs are kept of who accessed which files, when they accessed them, and what actions they performed (viewed, modified, deleted). These logs are crucial for detecting suspicious activity and performing forensic analysis after an incident.



### Why AAA Matters

* **Authentication** ensures only legitimate users get in.
* **Authorization** makes sure they only do what they're supposed to.



* **Accounting** ensures you can trace what happened if something goes wrong.

Together, they form a robust framework to protect systems, data, and users from unauthorized access and misuse.
